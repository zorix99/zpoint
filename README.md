## What works today

DeckCraft is in early development, heading for its first alpha (see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)).
Today it can:

- **Make decks**: slide masters and eleven layouts with placeholders that inherit position and
  formatting, eight original themes with colour and font schemes, sections, notes, comments,
  headers and footers, custom slide sizes.
- **Draw**: 150+ preset shapes with adjust handles, connectors that stay glued to shapes, freeform,
  curve and scribble tools, merge shapes (union, combine, fragment, intersect, subtract), gradient,
  picture and pattern fills, outlines with dashes and arrowheads, shadows, glow, soft edges and
  reflections.
- **Write**: in-place text editing with full font and paragraph formatting, bullets and numbering,
  columns, autofit, vertical text, fields and hyperlinks.
- **Add content**: pictures with crop and corrections, tables with styles, charts, SmartArt basics,
  audio and video (MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC, Ogg, Opus, WAV, AIFF; H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1).
- **Present**: transitions (including Morph), entrance/emphasis/exit and motion-path animations,
  by-paragraph builds, full-screen slide show, presenter view, pen, rehearse timings, media playback.
- **Exchange files**: open and save PowerPoint `.pptx`, export PDF (slides, notes pages, handouts
  with selectable text), PNG/JPEG and outlines. Unsaved work is kept by AutoRecover.
- **Automate**: 200+ commands with undo, all scriptable from the CLI, a JSON control channel and an
  MCP server for AI agents.

</p>

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft
cd deckcraft
cargo run --release -p deckcraft-cli -- render --sample --all --scale 1 out/
```

Fonts come from [craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts): clone it next to this repo
(`../craft-fonts`) and local builds pick it up automatically; without it DeckCraft uses your system
fonts.

## Agents, CLI and MCP

Every action in DeckCraft is a command with a stable id, so people, scripts and AI agents use the
same verbs:

```sh
deckcraft-cli commands format.          # list commands
deckcraft-cli run --sample --cmd 'slide.new={"layout":"titleOnly","title":"Hello"}' --save hello.deckcraft
deckcraft-cli mcp                       # MCP server over stdio (headless)
deckcraft-cli mcp --connect 7990        # drive the running app (deckcraft --control 7990)
```

## Roadmap

DeckCraft covers about **79% of PowerPoint's features by breadth** (93% of the core ones) and is
roughly **80% of the way to a first alpha**. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the alpha checklist,
parity estimates and what's next, and [docs/parity.md](docs/parity.md) for the feature-by-feature
scorecard.

## The Crafting Apps

DeckCraft is one of the **Crafting Apps**: free, open-source creative tools from the
[ArtCraft](https://getartcraft.com/) team, each written from scratch in Rust and each able to
stand on its own.
