//! DeckCraft in the browser.
//!
//! Runs the same [`deckcraft_ui_egui::SlideApp`] as the desktop app through eframe's web
//! runner (wgpu: WebGPU where available, WebGL2 otherwise). Build with `trunk build --release`
//! from this directory (output in `dist/web`).
//!
//! Differences from the desktop app:
//! - no TCP control channel (browsers can't listen on sockets);
//! - File → Open and Insert → Pictures/Audio/Video use the browser file picker; bytes arrive
//!   asynchronously through `Services::inbox` (presentations open, media is inserted);
//! - Save and Export trigger a browser download;
//! - dropped files are read asynchronously by `web::WebShell` and delivered through the inbox;
//! - preferences are not persisted.
//!
//! URL query flags: `?webgl` forces the WebGL2 backend instead of WebGPU; `?blank` starts with an
//! empty presentation instead of the sample deck; `?show` starts the slide show.
